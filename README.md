#LEAD -REICH
Linguistic Extraction and Analysis of Documents  Related to the Exploration and Interpretation of Constitutional History (LEAD REICH)
is a simple project demonstrating a.)  a full ETL process scraping text from webpages; b.) natural language processing to analyze controversial and dense legal documents and help inform data-driven opinions about constitutional law. 

## How this works
Due to the set-up of environments in my computer. the Python modules I needed for ETL were installed separate from the modules necessary for NLP. Hence, this project is divided into two parts: Part I deals with the extraction of data (about the Federalis Papers) from a public website; while Part II involves the use of Natural Language Processing techniques to derve insights from the data. 

## PART I: ETL 
There are eighty Federalist papers as recounted in the musical Hamilton; and all of them are available online from [this]() site. Since it would be tedious to manually retrieve the text for all eighty Federalist papers, I opted to automate the task by using web scraping tools Beautiful Soup and Selenium

## PART II: NLP
Natural Language Processing is a relatively new technique that has a wide array of applications. Computing tools can take dense texts and distill their gists in terms of n-grams, term frequencies, and themes. This can be applied with customer reviews for CRM, with personal writing for self-reflection,with legal documents to make data-backed analyses of legal opinion, and with literary pieces for quick comprehension of dense texts. For this project, two tools are specifically used: 1.) Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to obtain functions that are helpful for this analysis; and 2.) Natural Language Plot to gain access to visualization tools that make it easier to visually comprehend textual data.
