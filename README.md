# full-process-nlp-for-legal-analysis
A simple project demonstrating a.)  a full ETL process scraping text from webpages; b.) natural language processing to analyze controversial and dense legal documents and express data-driven opinions about constitutional law. 

## How this works
Due to the set-up of environments in my computer. the Python modules I needed for ETL were installed separate from the modules necessary for NLP. Hence, this project is divided into two parts: Part I deals with the extraction of data (about the Federalis Papers) from a public website; while Part II involves the use of Natural Language Processing techniques to derve insights from the data. 

## PART I: ETL 
There are eighty Federalist papers as recounted in the musical Hamilton; and all of them are available online from [this]() site. Since it would be tedious to manually retrieve the text for all eighty Federalist papers, I opted to automate the task by using web scraping tools. 

## PART II: NLP
